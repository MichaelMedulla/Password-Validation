This program validates a password that is inputed by the user.
The user inputs the password and it goes through the boolean validation function.
It first validates the length and is returned false if it does not meet the requirements.
It then checks to see if it meets the other 4 requirements.
For every one that is met a variable i increments.
If the password does not meet at least 3 requirements, the boolean is returned false.
